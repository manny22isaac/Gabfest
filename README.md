## What can this application be used for/in?
____________________________________________
Gabfest sends random questions (from any subreddit or question in general) to a users phone. Because the questions are original and engaging it offers a considerable amount of material for a conversation to begin. These discussions can range from funny and interesting, to serious and emotional.
## Who sends the questions?
A server will send GET requests to reddit's Rest API and then selects the questions by random according to the subreddit's that a user selects when an acount has made.
